# BookList - API for Creating and Sharing Book Collections
### Introduction
BookList is an open-source API that enables users to create and share personalized book recommendation lists, each organized around a specific theme or concept â€” similar to how playlists work in music streaming services like Spotify, but for books. Users can also write reviews for books, providing additional insights for others. With BookList, book lovers can easily create reading lists and discover new books, making it simpler to decide what to read next.
_Note: BookList does not provide access to the full text of the books; it focuses on recommendations and organization._

### Project Support Features
* Users can sign up and log in to their accounts.
* Non-authenticated users have read-only access to all book lists, reviews, and related information.
* Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own book lists, subscribe to other users' lists, and write reviews for books.
